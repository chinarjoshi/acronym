acronym syncs shell usage between development environments through aliases.
It implements CRUD operations on alias databases at different scopes.

There are 3 alias database scopes:
  global        defines aliases available everywhere
  project-wide  defines aliases specific to a git-tracked directory, which should be 
                     version-controlled and used by all contributors.
  local         same as above, but is local to your machine and in git ignore

Every entry in the database has the following string fields:
  alias     the new command you type
  command   the actual command the alias runs
  section   the category the alias falls under (for organization)
  comment   an optional description

Usage: acronym [OPTION ...] [SUBCOMMAND]

  -q, --quiet      Suppress output
  -v, --verbose    Use verbose output
  -h, --help       Give this help list
  -V, --version    Print program version

There are 4 subcommands (CRUD):

  create   Adds a new alias to the database by providing the command.
  read     Shows your aliases in TOML format, optionally filtered by the given patterns.
  update   Edit the database in TOML format using your default editor.
  delete   Remove aliases or whole sections from the database.
